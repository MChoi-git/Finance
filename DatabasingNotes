Good db design?
-Duplicate information is BAD
	-Wastes space and increases error %
-Correctness & completeness is important
-Therefore, good design:
	1. Divides info into subject-based tables to reduce redundancy
	2. Provides db with the info it requires to join the information in the tables together
	   as needed
	3. Helps support and ensure the accuracy and integrity of your information
	4. Accomodates your data processing and reporting needs
Design process:
	1. Determine the purpose of the db
	2. Find and organize the info req'd
		-{id, ticker name, EPS, previous day close, P/E, forward P/E, 52w low}
	3. Divide the info into tables
		-{tickers, ticker financials}
	4. Turn info items into columns
		-root:{id, ticker name}
		-info(AKA financials):{id,EPS, previous day close, 52w low}
		-ratios:{id,P/E, Forward P/E} (forward P/E tbd)
	5. Specify primary keys
		-primary key: id
	6. Set up the table relationships
	7. Refine the design
	8. Apply the normalization rules
